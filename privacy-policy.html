  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="muted">CashbackCard • Last updated: 22 Aug 2025</div>

  <div class="card">
    <p><strong>CashbackCard</strong> is an offline-first Android app that helps you decide which of your credit cards might give better cashback for a purchase. We respect your privacy. This policy explains what data we handle.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
  <p>CashbackCard does <strong>not collect</strong>, store, transmit, sell, or share any personal or sensitive user data. The app does not require an account or login and does not request your credit card numbers.</p>

  <h2>2. Offline Operation</h2>
  <p>The app is designed to work entirely offline using a built-in set of card rules. It does not make network requests. Future versions may offer an optional update check; if added, this feature will be opt-in and described clearly here.</p>

  <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app does not request runtime permissions beyond those required by Android for basic operation. It does not access contacts, location, microphone, camera, or storage (except standard app storage for local settings, if enabled in the future).</p>

  <h2>4. Analytics & Advertising</h2>
  <p>CashbackCard does not include third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as the app evolves. Material changes will be reflected by a new “Last updated” date and an updated version of the app.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, please contact: <a href="mailto:sreekarsai40@gmail.com">sreekarsai40@gmail.com</a></p>
